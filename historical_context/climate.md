The climate showed some variation over the first millennia with a significant cold period in the middle years.

1. [The Roman Warm Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Warm_Period)

The years 100AD to 400AD were significantly warmer and close to modern temperatures. 
This would have increased crop yields and enabled northern europe to support much larger populations with a wide array of crops.
At the end of the period there were significant [migrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_Period)


2. [Late Antique Ice Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Antique_Little_Ice_Age)

The climate began cooling after 400AD with a particularly cold phase 536-540AD due to volcanic ash clouds. 
Reduced crop yield would have put pressure on the expanded northern populations and would explain the migrations of the Goths south to warmer more fertile areas.

3. [Medieval Warm Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period)

Norse populations would have rebounded as the weather warmed opening up more pastures as well and crop lands and increased forest growth.
The improvements in boat design meant that instead of being limited to overland expansion various sea routes east and west became possible in the 8th and 9th centuries.
